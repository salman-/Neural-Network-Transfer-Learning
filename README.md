# Welcome to the Neural-Network-Transfer-Learning!


The transfer-learnign in Tensorflow can be done in different ways. For instance it could be:

1. "As is": Simply take an already-trained model and use it.
2. [Feature Extraction](https://github.com/salman-/Neural-Network-Transfer-Learning/wiki/Feature-Extraction): Take an already-trained model, but change its output layer
3. [Fine Tuning](https://github.com/salman-/Neural-Network-Transfer-Learning/wiki/Fine-tuning): Assemble frozen and unfrozen layers and create a new model.
